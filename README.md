# Optuna: A hyperparameter optimization framework

*Optuna* is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed
for machine learning. It features an imperative, *define-by-run* style user API. Thanks to our
*define-by-run* API, the code written with *Optuna* enjoys high modularity, and the user of
*Optuna* can dynamically construct the search spaces for the hyperparameters. *Optuna* also
features modern functionalities including parallel distributed optimization, premature pruning
of unpromising trials, and web dashboard.

## Installation
