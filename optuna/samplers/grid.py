class GridSampler(BaseSampler):
    """Sampler using grid search.

    This sampler is based on *relative sampling*.
    See also :class:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler` for more details of 'relative sampling'.

    Example:

        .. code::

            >>> import optuna
            >>>
            >>> def objective(trial):
            >>>     x = trial.suggest_uniform('x', -100, 100)
            >>>     y = trial.suggest_int('y', -100, 100)
            >>>     return x ** 2 + y ** 2
            >>>
            >>> grid = {
            >>>     'x': [-50, 0, 50],
            >>>     'y': [-99, 0, 99]
            >>> }
            >>> study = optuna.create_study(sampler=optuna.samplers.GridSampler(grid))
            >>> study.optimize(objective)

    Note:

        :class:`~optuna.samplers.GridSampler` does not take care of a parameter's quantization
        specified by discrete suggest methods but just samples one of values specified in the
        grid. E.g., in the following code snippet, either of ``-0.5`` or ``0.5`` is sampled as
        ``x`` instead of an integer point.

        .. code::

            >>> import optuna
            >>>
            >>> def objective(trial):
            >>>     # The following suggest method specifies an integer point between -5 and 5.
            >>>     x = trial.suggest_discrete_uniform('x' -5, 5, 1)
            >>>     return x ** 2
            >>>
            >>> # Non-int points are specified in the grid.
            >>> grid = {'x': [-0.5, 0.5]}
            >>> study = optuna.create_study(sampler=optuna.samplers.GridSampler(grid))
            >>> study.optimize(objective)

        grid:
            A dictionary whose key and value are a parameter name and the corresponding candidates
            of values, respectively.
