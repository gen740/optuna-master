class GroupDecompositionSampler(BaseSampler):
    """Sampler with a group decomposed search space.

    This sampler decomposes the search space based on past trials and samples from the joint
    distribution in each decomposed subspace.

    The search space is decomposed based on the following recursive rules.
    - Initialize the group of the search space with the empty set. The elements of the group are
    the subset of the search space, and the type is the dictionary of
    :class:`~optuna.distributions.BaseDistribution`.
    - Update the group with the following procedure `ADD(trial)` by looking at past trials.

    `Add(trial)`
    - Let ``T = trial.distributions`.
    - If the intersection of any element of the group and ``T`` is empty, add ``T`` to the group.
    - If an element ``S`` of the group is contained in ``T``, then add ``T-S`` to the group.
    We recursively add ``T-S`` to the group because the intersection of ``T-S`` and
    some other elements of the group may not be empty.
    - If an element ``S`` of a group contains ``T``, remove ``S`` from the group and add ``T``
    and ``S-T`` to the group.
    - If the intersection of an element ``S`` of the group and ``T`` is not empty, remove ``S``
    from the group and add ``Sâˆ©T``, ``S-T``, and ``T-S`` to the group.
    We recursively add ``T-S`` to the group because the intersection of ``T-S`` and
    some other elements of the group may not be empty.

    The group of the search space recursively constructed based on the above rules are disjoint and
    the union is the entire search space. We perform sampling from the joint distribution for each
    element of this decomposed group of the search space.

    Sampling from the joint distribution on the subspace is realized by
    :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_relative` of ``base_sampler`` specified by the user.


    Example:

       .. testcode::

           import optuna


           def objective(trial):
               x = trial.suggest_categorical("x", ["A", "B"])
               if x == "A":
                   return trial.suggest_float("y", -10, 10)
               else:
                   return trial.suggest_int("z", -10, 10)


           base_sampler = optuna.samplers.TPESampler(multivariate=True)
           sampler = optuna.samplers.GroupDecompositionSampler(base_sampler=base_sampler)
           study = optuna.create_study(sampler=sampler)
           study.optimize(objective, n_trials=10)
