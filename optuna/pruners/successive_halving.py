class SuccessiveHalvingPruner(BasePruner):

    """Pruner using Asynchronous Successive Halving Algorithm.

    `Successive Halving <https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07943>`_ is a bandit-based algorithm to
    identify the best one among multiple configurations. This class implements an asynchronous
    version of Successive Halving. Please refer to the paper of
    `Asynchronous Successive Halving <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_ for detailed descriptions.

    Note that, this class does not take care of the parameter for the maximum
    resource, referred to as ``R`` in the paper. The maximum resource allocated to a trial is
    typically limited inside the objective function (e.g., ``step`` number in `simple.py
    <https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/tree/c5777b3e/examples/pruning/simple.py#L31>`_,
    ``EPOCH`` number in `chainer_integration.py
    <https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/tree/c5777b3e/examples/pruning/chainer_integration.py#L65>`_).

    Example:

        We minimize an objective function with ``SuccessiveHalvingPruner``.

        .. code::

            >>> from optuna import create_study
            >>> from optuna.pruners import SuccessiveHalvingPruner
            >>>
            >>> def objective(trial):
            >>>     ...
            >>>
            >>> study = create_study(pruner=SuccessiveHalvingPruner())
            >>> study.optimize(objective)

    Args:
        min_resource:
            A parameter for specifying the minimum resource allocated to a trial
            (in the `paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_ this parameter is
            referred to as "r").

            More precisely, a trial is never pruned until it executes
            ``min_resource * (reduction_factor ** min_early_stopping_rate)`` steps
            (i.e., the completion point of the first rung). When the trial completes the first
            rung, it will be promoted to the next rung only if the value of the trial is placed in
            the top ``1/reduction_factor`` fraction of the whole trials that already have reached
            the point (otherwise it will be pruned there). If the trial won
            the competition, it continues to execute its work until the next rung completion point
            (i.e., ``min_resource * (reduction_factor ** (min_early_stopping_rate + rung))`` steps)
            is reached and then repeats the same process with a new ``rung``.
        reduction_factor:
            A parameter for specifying reduction factor of promotable trials
            (in the `paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_ this parameter is
            referred to as "eta").
            At the completion point of each rung, about ``1/reduction_factor`` trials
            will be promoted.
        min_early_stopping_rate:
            A parameter for specifying the minimum early-stopping rate
            (in the `paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_ this parameter is
            referred to as "s").
