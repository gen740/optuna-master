class SuccessiveHalvingPruner(BasePruner):

    """Pruner using the Asynchronous Successive Halving Algorithm (ASHA).

    ASHA is an algorithm that enables to tune hyperparameters in massively parallel settings.
    It defines rounds (named "rung") started from ``0``.
    When a trial completed the current rung, it competes with other trials that have completed
    the same rung. And if it wins the competition, the trial will be promoted to the next rung
    for continuing the work. Conversely, the losers will be pruned there.
    This process is repeated until the trial finishes. Please refer to
    `the original paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_
    for a detailed description of the algorithm.

    Note that, unlike the paper, ``SuccessiveHalvingPruner`` recognizes only "number of steps" as
    the resource consumed by a trial (in the paper, for example, the input data size can be treated
    as a resource). Besides, it does not have a parameter to restrict the maximum resource usage
    (called ``R`` in the paper). The maximum number of steps executed by a trial is implicitly
    limited by users via implementation specific parameters (e.g., ``step`` number in `simple.py
    <https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/tree/c5777b3e/examples/pruning/simple.py#L31>`_,
    ``EPOCH`` number in `chainer_integration.py
    <https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/tree/c5777b3e/examples/pruning/chainer_integration.py#L65>`_).

    Example:

        We minimize an objective function with ``SuccessiveHalvingPruner``.

        .. code::

            >>> from optuna import create_study
            >>> from optuna.pruners import SuccessiveHalvingPruner
            >>>
            >>> def objective(trial):
            >>>     ...
            >>>
            >>> study = create_study(pruner=SuccessiveHalvingPruner())
            >>> study.optimize(objective)

    Args:
        min_resource:
            A parameter for specifying the minimum resource allocated to a trial
            (in the `paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_ this parameter is denoted by "r").

            More precisely, a trial is never pruned until it executes
            ``min_resource * reduction_factor`` steps
            (i.e., the completion point of the first rung). When it completes the first rung,
            it will be promoted to the next rung only if the value of the trial is placed in
            the top ``1/reduction_factor`` fraction of the whole trials that already have reached
            the point (otherwise it will be pruned there). If the trial won
            the competition, it continues to execute its work until the next rung completion point
            (i.e., ``min_resource * (reduction_factor ** rung)`` steps) is
            reached and then repeats the same process with a new ``rung``.

            Please see also the description about ``n_warmup_rungs``
            if you would specify the value of ``n_warmup_rungs`` other than ``0``.
        reduction_factor:
            A parameter for specifying reduction factor of promotable trials
            (in the `paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_ this parameter is denoted by "eta").
            At the completion point of each rung, about ``1/reduction_factor`` trials
            will be promoted.
        n_warmup_rungs:
            A parameter for specifying the first rung from which competitions occur
            (in the `paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05934>`_ this parameter is denoted by "s").
            Until completing the rung, all trials will be promoted unconditionally.
