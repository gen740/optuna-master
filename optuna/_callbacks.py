class MaxTrialsCallback:
    """Set a maximum number of trials before ending the study.

    While the :obj:`n_trials` argument of :obj:`optuna.optimize` sets the number of trials that
    will be run, you may want to continue running until you have a certain number of successfullly
    completed trials or stop the study when you have a certain number of trials that fail.
    This :obj:`MaxTrialsCallback` class allows you to set a maximum number of trials for a
    particular :class:`~optuna.trial.TrialState` before stopping the study.

    Example:

        .. testcode::

            import optuna
            from optuna.study import MaxTrialsCallback
            from optuna.trial import TrialState


            def objective(trial):
                x = trial.suggest_float("x", -1, 1)
                return x ** 2


            study = optuna.create_study()

            The max number of trials. Must be set to an integer.
        states:
            Tuple of the :class:`~optuna.trial.TrialState` to be counted
            towards the max trials limit. Default value is :obj:`(TrialState.COMPLETE,)`.
