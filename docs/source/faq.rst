Can I use Optuna with X? (where X is your favorite ML library)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Optuna is compatible with most ML libraries, and it's easy to use Optuna with those.
Please refer to `examples <https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/tree/master/examples>`_.


How to define objective functions that have own arguments?
----------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to realize it.

First, callable classes can be used for that purpose as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import optuna

    class Objective(object):
        def __init__(self, min_x, max_x):
            # Hold this implementation specific arguments as the fields of the class.
            self.min_x = min_x
            self.max_x = max_x

        def __call__(self, trial):
            # Calculate an objective value by using the extra arguments.
            x = trial.suggest_uniform('x', self.min_x, self.max_x)
            return (x - 2) ** 2

    # Execute an optimization by using an `Objective` instance.
    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(Objective(-100, 100), n_trials=100)


Second, you can use ``lambda`` or ``functools.partial`` for creating functions (closures) that hold extra arguments.
Below is an example that uses ``lambda``:

.. code-block:: python

    import optuna

    # Objective function that takes three arguments.
    def objective(trial, min_x, max_x):
        x = trial.suggest_uniform('x', min_x, max_x)
        return (x - 2) ** 2

    # Extra arguments.
    min_x = -100
    max_x = 100

    # Execute an optimization by using the above objective function wrapped by `lambda`.
    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(lambda trial: objective(trial, min_x, max_x), n_trials=100)


Can I use Optuna without remote RDB servers?
--------------------------------------------

Yes, it's possible.

In the simplest form, Optuna works with in-memory storage:

.. code-block:: python

    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(objective)


If you want to save and resume studies,  it's handy to use SQLite as the local storage:

.. code-block:: python

    study = optuna.create_study(study_name='foo_study', storage='sqlite:///example.db')
    study.optimize(objective)  # The state of `study` will be persisted to the local SQLite file.

Please see :ref:`rdb` for more details.


How can I obtain reproducible optimization results?
---------------------------------------------------

To make the parameters suggested by Optuna reproducible, you can specify a fixed random seed via ``seed`` argument of :class:`~optuna.samplers.RandomSampler` or :class:`~optuna.samplers.TPESampler` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    sampler = TPESampler(seed=10)  # Make the sampler behave in a deterministic way.
    study = optuna.create_study(sampler=sampler)
    study.optimize(objective)

However, there are two caveats.

First, when optimizing a study in distributed or parallel mode, there is inherent non-determinism.
Thus it is impossible (or, at least, very difficult) to reproduce the same results in such condition.

Second, if your objective function behaves in a non-deterministic way (i.e., it does not return the same value nevertheless the same parameters were suggested), it is impossible to reproduce an optimization, too.
