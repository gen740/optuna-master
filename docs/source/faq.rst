How do I use Optuna for Chainer, XGBoost, LightGBM and others?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Using Optuna with those is easy.
Please refer to `examples <https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/tree/master/examples>`_ for code that works.
Besides, we provide various :doc:`integrations <reference/integration>` for advanced features (e.g., pruning, distributed optimization).
