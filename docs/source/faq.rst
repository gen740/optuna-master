Can I use Optuna with X? (where X is your favorite ML library)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Optuna is compatible with most ML libraries, and it's easy to use Optuna with those.
Please refer to `examples <https://github.com/pfnet/optuna/tree/master/examples>`_.


How to define objective functions that have own arguments?
----------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to realize it.

First, callable classes can be used for that purpose as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import optuna

    class Objective(object):
        def __init__(self, min_x, max_x):
            # Hold this implementation specific arguments as the fields of the class.
            self.min_x = min_x
            self.max_x = max_x

        def __call__(self, trial):
            # Calculate an objective value by using the extra arguments.
            x = trial.suggest_uniform('x', self.min_x, self.max_x)
            return (x - 2) ** 2

    # Execute an optimization by using an `Objective` instance.
    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(Objective(-100, 100), n_trials=100)


Second, you can use ``lambda`` or ``functools.partial`` for creating functions (closures) that hold extra arguments.
Below is an example that uses ``lambda``:

.. code-block:: python

    import optuna

    # Objective function that takes three arguments.
    def objective(trial, min_x, max_x):
        x = trial.suggest_uniform('x', min_x, max_x)
        return (x - 2) ** 2

    # Extra arguments.
    min_x = -100
    max_x = 100

    # Execute an optimization by using the above objective function wrapped by `lambda`.
    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(lambda trial: objective(trial, min_x, max_x), n_trials=100)


Can I use Optuna without remote RDB servers?
--------------------------------------------

Yes, it's possible.

In the simplest form, Optuna works with in-memory storage:

.. code-block:: python

    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(objective)


If you want to save and resume studies,  it's handy to use SQLite as the local storage:

.. code-block:: python

    study = optuna.create_study(study_name='foo_study', storage='sqlite:///example.db')
    study.optimize(objective)  # The state of `study` will be persisted to the local SQLite file.

Please see :ref:`rdb` for more details.


How to suppress log messages of Optuna?
---------------------------------------

By default, Optuna shows log messages at the ``optuna.logging.INFO`` level.
You can change logging levels by using  :func:`optuna.logging.set_verbosity`.

For instance, you can stop showing each trial result as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    optuna.logging.set_verbosity(optuna.logging.WARNING)

    study = optuna.create_study()
    study.optimize(objective)
    # Logs like '[I 2018-12-05 11:41:42,324] Finished a trial resulted in value:...' are disabled.


Please refer to :class:`optuna.logging` for further details.


How to save a machine learning model trained in an objective function?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Optuna saves hyperparameter values with its corresponding objective value to storage,
but it discards intermediate objects such as machine learning models and neural network weights.
To save models or weights, please use features of the machine learning library you used.

We recommend saving :obj:`~optuna.trial.Trial.trail_id` with a model in order to identify its corresponding trial.
For example, you can save SVM models trained in the objective function as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def objective(trial):
        svc_c = trial.suggest_loguniform('svc_c', 1e-10, 1e10)
        clf = sklearn.svm.SVC(C=svc_c)
        clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Save a trained model to a file.
        joblib.dump(clf, '{}.joblib'.format(trial.trial_id))
        return 1.0 - accuracy_score(y_test, clf.predict(X_test))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        study = optuna.create_study()
        study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)

        # Load the best model.
        best_clf = joblib.load('{}.joblib'.format(study.best_trial.trial_id))
        print(accuracy_score(y_test, best_clf.predict(X_test)))
