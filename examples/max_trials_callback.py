"""
Optuna example that demonstrates setting maximum number of trials in
a shared database when multiple workers are used.

In this example, we optimize a simple quadratic function. We use multiple
script runs(workers) to demonstrate the use of max_trial_callbacks,
which essentially allows user to set maximum number of trials
regardless of the number of workers/scripts running the Trials.
